# ✍️ Elm-pen

Elm-pen is a small CLI tool that lets you generate Elm files using [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/).

It comes with a few templates out of the box, but you can also add your own templates or change the existing ones if you want.

**This project is still in an alpha phase.**
If you encounter bugs or have issues setting it up, then you will have to fix it yourself.
I kindly ask you to also add an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Orasund/elm-pen/issues/new) and a pull request once you fixed it, so that i know what went wrong.

## Installation

```npm install -g elm-pen```

## Generating Files

```elm-pen```

On the first run, it will generate a `elm-pen.json` aswell as some example files. Change `elm-pen.json` and then just rerun the command.
