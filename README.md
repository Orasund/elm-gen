# Elm-Gen

Elm-gen is a small CLI tool that lets you generate elm-files using [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/).

It comes with a few templates out of the box, but you can also add your own templates or change the existing ones if you want.

**This project is still in an alpha phase.**
If you encounter bugs or have issues setting it up, then you will have to fix it yourself.
I kindly ask you to also add an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Orasund/elm-gen/issues/new) and a pull request once you fixed it, so that i know what went wrong.

## Installation

1. Clone this project
2. Run `mpn run build`
3. Run `mpn link`
4. Go into your project
5. Run `elm-gen`
6. (optional) add `elm-gen/generated` to your `.gitignore`.

Now you are ready to go. You can modify the config file, add new templates or checkout the js file if you really want to get your hands dirty.
